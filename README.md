As a team we will collectively discuss rules regulating how our team works.

1.	Use “pair programming” not in the literal sense, as we are an online class, but lets go over each others code. Each team member is better at something than the other, if we look over each others code, we could find flaws, improve code readability, and improve resource management.
2.	Be Descriptive - make sure classes and methods are named descriptively so that anyone looking at the code know exactly what they are looking at.
3.	Keep methods short and sweet - You can encapsulate a method 
Ie:
public void Part1()
{
	Part2();
}
public void Part2()
{
	y = x + 2;
}
This allows methods to be shorter and easier to read.

4.	If you’re stuck, ask for help asap. We are all busy, and it can take time for someone to respond. The sooner we ask, the sooner we can get assistance. 
5.	Comment, comment, comment your code. So others can follow it.
